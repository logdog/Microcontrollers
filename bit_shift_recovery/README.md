## Recovery? What's this about? Didn't you already lose the files?

#### Short answer: yes.
#### Long answer: maybe.
So an rm doesn't actually delete any data in the computer's memory. It only removes a pointer (reference) to the position in memory where the file is stored. Then the block is memory where the old file was is set as free real estate on memory lane, and that the computer is allowed to fill this new area with any new files it would like. This means, with a little luck, the file has yet to be overridden, and, because I remember a few functions in my original code, I should be able to write some cpp code to read every location in memory, converting the values stored at these locations into chars using utf-8 encoding, notifying me when a certain pattern has been found so I can investigate that location more thoroughly and at least partly recover the file. The difficulty arrises where writing this test script has the possibility of overwriting the file I'm trying to find. To avoid this, I will find an old script that I don't want anymore that has some length to it, and then just write my code inside that file. This should only reduce the changes of an overwrite marginally, but I'll take everything I can get.
